# Kotlin OOP Task 2 - Gnomes on Steps

Gnomes are placed on some steps in the garden. The top step is #1, the lowest step is #10

Rules:
- Only one gnome can be on a step at a time
- Gnomes can be shifted to different steps, but only if they are unoccupied
- Gnomes can be moved up and down the steps, but not above the top step (1), nor below the lowest (10)
- If Gnomes are moving up/down, and the target step is occupied, they take the step before
