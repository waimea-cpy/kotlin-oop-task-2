# Kotlin OOP Task 2 - Gnome Fight Club

Those gnomes have started a fight club!

```
   /\        /\
  ('')  VS  (oo)
__{__}______{__}__
```

Notes:
- Gnomes have a strength value from 1-10
- Gnomes have a health level from 0-100
- Gnomes can train to increase strength
- When gnomes fight, they both lose health based on the strength of the opponent
- Gnomes die when health is zero
